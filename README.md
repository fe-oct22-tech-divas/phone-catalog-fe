# Structure
Our app has been constructed using functional components and React Hooks, resulting in a streamlined and efficient development process. We've taken care to ensure that each component is highly abstract and fully reusable, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of use. To maintain consistency and improve styling, we've leveraged Sass (SCSS) and CSS Modules. Furthermore, we've adhered to the BEM methodology for naming and styling, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.
